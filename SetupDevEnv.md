It looks like you provided the IP address for a Jenkins server (4.246.167.105) and mentioned that the user is `azureuser`. Here's how you can SSH into this Jenkins server and set up a connection from your laptop:

### Step 1: Generate SSH Key Pair on Your Laptop
Open a terminal on your laptop and use the following command to generate an SSH key pair. When prompted, you can press Enter to use the default file location and create the key without a passphrase for simplicity, although using a passphrase is recommended for increased security.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

### Step 2: Copy the Public Key to the Jenkins Server
Now you need to copy the public key to the Jenkins server. This can typically be done using the `ssh-copy-id` command. Replace `your_public_key.pub` with the path to your public key if it's not the default (`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`).

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub azureuser@4.246.167.105
```

You will be prompted to enter the password for `azureuser` the first time you do this.

### Step 3: SSH into the Jenkins Server
Once the key is added, you can SSH into the server without a password:

```bash
ssh azureuser@4.246.167.105
```

### Step 4: Verify Connection
To ensure the connection is established, you should now be logged into the Jenkins server. You can try running a simple command like `ls` or `pwd` to check if you're in the right user directory.

### Step 5: Configure Local Git Environment (If Required)
If you plan to use the same SSH keys for GitHub as well, you should add your public SSH key to your GitHub account:

1. Open the public key file with a text editor and copy the contents.
2. Go to your GitHub account settings.
3. Navigate to "SSH and GPG keys".
4. Click on "New SSH key", paste your public key, and save.

To configure your local Git environment to use this SSH key with GitHub, you can set the SSH key in your Git config:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

Set the SSH key to be used with GitHub:
```bash
git config --global core.sshCommand "ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa"
```

### Step 6: Secure the Private Key
Ensure your private key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa` by default) is kept secure and private. Set the correct permissions if not already set:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This sequence of steps will help you to securely connect to your Jenkins server using SSH and set up your local Git environment for GitHub commits.
